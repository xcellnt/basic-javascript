CREATE VARIABLE:
 - camleCase
 - can directly with value
   var firstName = "Cornor";
 - can just declare the variable
   var firstName;

BENEFIT:
 - reuseable

note:
 - before 2015 to create variable use var
 - since ECMAScript 2015, introduced new key to create variable let and const 
 - and now didn't recomende using var

   let firstName = "Cornor";
   let  firstName;

 - const sometime for constant
